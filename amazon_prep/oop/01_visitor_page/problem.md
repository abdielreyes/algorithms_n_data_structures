# Visitor Page

Design a class with two methods:\

- visit(username)
- getFirstVisitor()
  The **visit()** method records the activity of a username on the website. If the **visit()** function is called, it means a username has accessed the website once. A user can access the website multiple times. \
  The **getFirstVisitor()** method returns the earliest username which visited the website just once (if there are multiple users whi visited the website once, the method should return the earliest username)

_hint_ Use dictionary and queue
