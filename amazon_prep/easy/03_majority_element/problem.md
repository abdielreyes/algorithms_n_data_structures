# Majority Problem

Given an array _nums_ of size _n_, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than **[n/2]** times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example 1

`Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3`

## Example 2

`Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2`
